Here is a very detailed prompt designed for image generation models (like Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion) to replicate the specific style of the "Love is..." (Kim Casali) comic strip.

### The Master Prompt

> **A vertical vintage single-panel comic strip in the iconic style of Kim Casali's 'Love is...' series from the 1970s. The artwork features two stylized, chibi-like characters: a boy with short dark hair and a girl with long blonde hair and freckles. The characters have large heads, small simple bodies, and dot eyes with no mouths or very simple facial expressions.**
>
> **The scene depicts [insert your scenario here, e.g., the boy looking sadly at his belly while holding a hand mirror, wearing a striped shirt and blue pants, while the girl in a red dress comforts him by touching his arm].**
>
> **The art style is hand-drawn ink line art with flat, slightly imperfect marker-style coloring. The lines are sketchy and organic, not vector-perfect. The background is a textured, aged, cream-colored paper or parchment. At the top left, mimic the text layout with "Love is..." in a serif font. At the top right, include the signature two bright red hearts overlapping. At the bottom, include a block of typewriter-style text. The overall aesthetic is nostalgic, whimsical, and warm, resembling a scanned newspaper clipping or a vintage gum wrapper insert.**

### Breakdown of the Style Parameters
If you are using a tool that allows for specific parameter tuning (like Stable Diffusion), here are the key elements to emphasize:

*   **Subject:** Kim Casali style, "Love is..." characters, cartoon couple, chibi proportions.
*   **Medium:** Ink and watercolor, felt-tip pen drawing, vintage print.
*   **Texture:** Grainy paper, yellowed paper, newsprint texture, matte finish.
*   **Colors:** Muted primaries (faded red, blue, yellow), cream background, black ink.
*   **Layout:** Vertical rectangle, polaroid-style spacing (space at top and bottom for text).

### Example Modification
If you want to generate the **exact image** you sent, replace the bracketed section in the prompt above with this:

> "...The scene depicts the boy standing on the left, looking distressed and looking down at his exposed stomach, holding a yellow hand mirror. He is wearing a brown and white striped t-shirt and blue trousers. The girl stands on the right, wearing a red sleeveless dress with small hearts at the hem, smiling gently and placing a comforting hand on his stomach..."

### Negative Prompt (What to avoid)
Use this if your AI allows negative prompts to ensure the style doesn't drift:

> *Photorealistic, 3D render, shiny, glossy, high definition, detailed anatomy, noses, distinct fingers, vector art, digital painting, gradients, neon colors, bright white background, anime style, manga style.*
